		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>Hi, I'm Jahla. I'm a geek, armchair philosopher, sometimes fashion designer, and occasional social commentator from Canberra, Australia.</p>
		<img class="profile-pic" src="/img/me.png" width="128" height="128" alt="Picture of me" />
		<p>I’m a lib­eral and cre­ative arts advo­cate, and often found Dj-ing, design­ing alter­na­tive fash­ion, indulging my love of anime, and geek­ing out on my beloved Mac­book Pro... I studied con­ti­nen­tal phi­los­o­phy, cli­ma­tol­ogy, and climate policy at the Aus­tralian National Uni­ver­sity, and did my Philosophy Hon­ours the­sis on Anx­i­ety in Heidegger’s ‘Being and Time’.</p>
