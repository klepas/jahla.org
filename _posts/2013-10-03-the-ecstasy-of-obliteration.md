Why do we seem to yearn for obliteration? Why do we fantasise it, court it, flee from it so securely? For the sake of our own serenity, complacency, we place its calm, ecstatic peace at the core of our dreams and the corners of our consciousness. Is this how we cope with the mundane business of life? 

We quell our passion for living by glorifying, idolising — what? Just so that we can go on? To mask that childish voice that screams, I want more life? Not life that is longer, but life that is less safe, that is — alive. This ecstasy that is obliteration, that allows us in mythologising, deifying, _sanitising_, to obliterate the nuance and possibilities of its actualisation. And this flight we so lament: you and I, we seek this flight.
